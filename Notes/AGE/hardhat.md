# *Debugging with Hardhat Network*

*Hardhat comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code. It's the default network Hardhat connects to, so you don't need to setup anything for it to work. Just run your tests.*
